Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
I don't need to store the messages in database, only notify the chat that a user has connected or disconnected.
- [x] Add support for nicknames.
I can store nicknames in database and have a button for creating a nickname. How would I keep the nickname persistent? 
- [x] Don't send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter.
- [x] Add "{user} is typing" functionality.

- [x] Show who's online.
- [x] Add private messaging.
- [x] Share your improvements!
